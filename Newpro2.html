<h1>Overview of data preprocessing in data mining</h1>
<body>
<h2> Introduction of Data mining : </h2>
<p align="center"> 
Information mining is a manner of looking and reading a big batch of uncooked records with a 
view to perceive layout and extract beneficial data .for instance: In these days is global the amount of 
information is increasing  Exponentially whether or not it is biomedical statistics , security information or 
online purchasing statistics many industries maintain the statistics in an effort to analyzing eighty that 
they could serve their clients more efficiently via , the information which they take out from big hold facts 
this taking away or digging out information from huge records set obtained from one-of-a-kind sources 
and industries is referred to as statistics mining .

<h2>DATA MINING PREPROCESSING :</h2>
 A record mining is the technique of sorting through large quantity of statistics units to perceive 
data and relationships, statistics mining is also referred to as knowledge Discovery records (KDD). It is 
able to help clear up enterprise problems all over information evaluation. Statistics mining preprocessing is 
a information mining technique that involves remodeling comprehensible format to uncooked statistics. 
Records mining is a subject intersection of laptop technology and statistical used to uncover patterns 
within the statistics retrieval .the principle purpose of the records mining processing is to extract the 
beneficial information from report of the information and version, it an comprehensible shape for future 
use .

<h2> DATA CLEANING:</h2>
A Record cleaning is an important step within the records preparation technique, which entails figuring 
out, and rectifying mistakes, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in datasets to make certain their great and 
reliability. Clean data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling in various fields, including business, 
research, and machine learning. Here are the key steps and considerations involved in data cleaning.

<h2> DATA INTEGRATION:</h2>
The process of combining data and harmonizing data from different resources into a unified view,
it's also known as data Integration. In modern business and technology landscapes, organizations
generate and store data in various formats, locations, and systems. Data integration aims to overcome 
the challenges posed by this fragmented data by creating a coherent and comprehensive dataset 
that can be used for analysis, reporting, decision-making, and other business processes

<h2> DATA TRANSFORMATION:</h2>
Statistics transformation refers back to the manner of converting and restructuring information from one 
format, shape, or illustration into another.This procedure is often carried out to make and reshaping facts. 
Right here are a few not unusual aspects and strategies of information transformation.

<h2> DATA REDUCTION:</h2>

Statistics reduction refers back to the procedure of reducing the sum of data in a dataset 
whilst keeping its essential traits and information.This is frequently done to address demanding
situations related to garage, processing, and analysis of huge volumes of statistics.
Data reduction strategies are generally utilized in various fields, which include information mining,
gadget studying, signal processing,and more. The intention is to create a smaller representation of
the records that also captures the vital patterns, developments, and relationships gift inside the unique dataset.
